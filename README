# sfApply plugin #

Most public sites have similar needs where user registration is
concerned. In order to slow down spam a little bit and get a grip
on who's doing what, you want users to apply for accounts and 
confirm them by clicking on a link in an email message. 

Symfony's sfGuardPlugin does a fine job managing the accounts you 
already have but doesn't provide a built-way for users to apply for and
create accounts. sfApply adds that capability.

sfApplyPlugin also implements a password reset feature that works
correctly and also requires users to confirm via email. This prevents a 
user who has discovered a momentarily unattended PC from 
taking over the account too easily.

## Requirements ##

You need:

* sfGuardPlugin

* Propel

A Symfony 1.2-plus-Doctrine version of this plugin will
follow shortly.

## Installation ##

Read the sfGuardPlugin documentation first! Set up that plugin before
continuing.

Then add the following to your `schema.yml`:

    propel:
      sf_guard_user_profile:
        _attributes:
          phpName: sfGuardUserProfile
        user_id:
          type: integer
          foreignTable: sf_guard_user
          foreignReference: id
          required: true
          onDelete: cascade
        email:
          type: varchar(80)
          index: yes
        fullname:
          type: varchar(80)
         validate:
          type: varchar(17)
          index: yes

Note that sfApplyPlugin takes advantage of the "user profile"
functionality offered by sfGuardPlugin as a place to store
additional information. While sfGuardPlugin makes the name of the
profile class configurable, sfApplyPlugin simply uses the
default name (sfGuardUserProfile) for simplicity.

"But where do I put my own additional fields?" That's why I didn't
build sfGuardUserProfile's schema directly into the plugin. Just
add your additional fields after the full name field.

"Shouldn't there be yet another profile class for my stuff?" In theory,
that might be nice. In practice, before you know it you'll be joining 
28 tables every time someone accesses the page. Paste this one
snippet of code just once instead.

You will also want to add the following routes to your `config/routing.yml`.
The URLs are just suggestions, you can change them if you don't like them.
Note that this plugin provides a working solution for users who have 
forgotten their passwords. Mapping the `sf_guard_password` route to 
`sfApply/reset-request` allows the "forgot your password?" link in
the default sfGuardPlugin login form to work.

    apply:
      url:  /apply
      param: { module: sfApply, action: apply }

    reset:
      url: /reset
      param: { module: sfApply, action: reset }

    resetRequest:
      url: /reset-request
      param: { module: sfApply, action: resetRequest }

    validate:
      url: /confirm/:validate
      param: { module: sfApply, action: confirm }

    settings:
      url: /settings
      param: { module: sfApply, action: settings }

    # We implement the missing sf_guard_password feature from sfGuardPlugin
    sf_guard_password:
      url: /reset-request
      param: { module: sfApply, action: resetRequest }

If you have enabled the built-in routes in sfGuardPlugin, 
then overriding `sf_guard_password` here might not work. You can
fix that by copying `sfGuardPlugin/modules/sfGuardAuth/templates/loginSuccess.php`
to your application and editing the "forgot your password?" link to
point to `sfApply/resetRequest` instead.

Activate the `sfApply` module in your application's
`settings.yml` file:

    enabled_modules:        [default, sfGuardAuth, sfApply]

Note that you also need the `sfGuardAuth` module to enable logins.

Configure the "from" address and full name for email messages sent by
sfApplyPlugin in your `app.yml` file:

      sfApplyPlugin:
        from:
          email: "your@emailaddress.com"
          fullname: "the staff at yoursite.com"

*Important: sfApplyPlugin will not work* unless you configure these
options! The plugin will fail with a less than informative error message
(although a more informative one appears in the log file).
My apologies for leaving this rather important information out of the
documentation of the earliest versions.

Now you can easily add a button to your pages sending users to
`sfApply/apply` to request accounts:

    echo button_to("Create Account", "sfApply/apply");

You will almost certainly also want to copy 
sfGuardPlugin's `modules/sfGuardAuth/templates/signinSuccess.php` to
your own application's modules folder and add a "Create Account"
link to it, so that users understand they can make accounts 
of their own at what would otherwise be the most frustrating point 
in your application.

## Customizing Emails ##

sfApply sends out email messages inviting users to verify their
accounts or reset their passwords. You can customize these by
copying `modules/sfApply/templates/sendValidateNew.php` and
`modules/sfApply/templates/sendValidateReset.php` from the plugin to
your application and editing them. The default emails aren't
that bad; they do contain the name of your site. But you really ought 
to customize these so that users get a warm, fuzzy, personal sense that the
messages are not spam. 

If you want to send HTML emails, you should create separate
plaintext versions named `sendValidateNew.altbody.php` and 
`sendValidateReset.altbody.php` for plain text. When Symfony sees these, 
it will automatically expect HTML in `sendValdiateNew.php` and 
`sendValidateReset.php`.

This approach to email is not supported in Symfony 1.2. I'll be
looking at alternate solutions for 1.2.

## Displaying Login and Logout Prompts on Every Page ##

You probably have pages on which logging in is optional. It's nice to
display a login prompt directly on these pages. If you want to do that,
try including my login/logout prompt template from your
`apps/frontend/templates/layout.php` file:

    <?php include_partial('sfApply/login') ?>

If you are using the provided stylesheet, the login prompt will
be floated at the far right, so you'll want to emit this code
before anything that should appear to the left of the prompt.

When the user is already logged in, the login prompt is 
automatically replaced by a logout prompt.

## Using the Suggested Stylesheet ##

sfApply comes with a stylesheet. You don't have to use it. If you do,
you'll get reasonable styles for the sfApply pages as well as a
reasonably good-looking style for the sfGuardPlugin login page. 

If you wish to use my stylesheet directly, first make sure you have a 
symbolic link from `web/sfApplyPlugin` to `plugins/sfApplyPlugin/web`. Then add
the stylesheet to your view.yml file:

      stylesheets:    [main, /sfApplyPlugin/css/login-apply]

In the long run, you'll probably want to borrow from it rather than
using it directly.

## Extending sfApply ##

"But I need the user's birthdate!" Of course you do. Every application
needs something extra. Here's how to go about it:

1. Add your extra fields to `sfGuardUserProfile` in your
  `schema.yml`.
2. Create a `modules/sfApply/templates` folder in your application.
3. Copy my `applySuccess.php` and `settingsSuccess.php` files over.
4. Add the form fields you need for your additional information
  to those templates. 
5. Copy `sfApplyPlugin/modules/sfApply/actions/actions.class.php` to
  your own `modules/sfApply/actions` folder. Notice that this class is
  initially empty. That's because it inherits its default
  behavior from 
  `sfApplyPlugin/modules/sfApply/lib/BasesfApplyActions.class.php`.
6. Extend the `populateProfileSettings` method to save
  additional information to the profile when an account
  is first created:

        function populateProfileSettings($profile)
        {
          $birthday = $this->getRequestParameter('birthday');
          $profile->setBirthday($birthday);
          // Don't forget to call the parent class version!
          return parent::populateProfileSettings($profile);
        }

7. Extend `updateProfileSettings` in exactly the same way. The
difference is that `updateProfileSettings` is called when the
user edits their settings later, while `populateProfileSettings`
is called only the first time. If your needs in both situations
are similar, I suggest that you keep the shared code in a private method
that you call from both.
8. Optionally override `validateApply` and `validateSettings` as well.
Again, be sure to call the parent class versions before
returning and return false if the parent class version
returns false.

## Changelog ##

### Version 0.6 ###

Version 0.62 corrects a documentation bug: I neglected to mention
the importance of configuring the "from" address for emails sent
by sfApplyPlugin. If you do not do so the account confirmation and
password reset email messages will never be sent. See above.

Version 0.61 had a minor markdown problem with the README.

Version 0.6 adds the optional sfApply/_login.php template, which provides
an easy way to insert a login prompt on every page. I realized I was
using this code in two sites and that others would likely want to 
do the same thing. Just include it in your layout template.

Version 0.6 also adds a suggested stylesheet. Use it or not as you
see fit. In addition to styling the apply and reset pages, it also
styles the standard sfGuardUser login page. 

Version 0.6 renames all of the CSS classes and ids emitted by sfApplyPlugin
in order to avoid potential conflicts with your own CSS elements.

### Version 0.53 ###

Version 0.53 corrected Markdown errors in the documentation. There
were no code changes from version 0.5, which was the first 
public release.
